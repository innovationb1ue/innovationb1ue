### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on courseworks of MSC. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning golang. But barely find any interesting project to do. 
- ðŸ“« Reach me at : 517262600@qq.com  or sa21115@bristol.ac.uk. 
- âš¡ Wanna do: Feel free to contact me if you need a collaborator for your awesome awesome Python, Golang project. 
- Also I really do think `c++` is so cool. But this language obviously will swallow tons of my time and I need a good project(reason) to light the fire.
